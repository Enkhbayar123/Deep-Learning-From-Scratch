# Deep-Learning-From-Scratch
A Python implementation of Deep Learning models (MLP and CNN) built entirely from first principles using NumPy.  This repository avoids high-level frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow to demonstrate a fundamental understanding of the mathematics behind neural networks, including backpropagation, gradient descent, and tensor operations.
